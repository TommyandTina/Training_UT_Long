CMM Test Utility for R-Car Gen3 based platforms

Description
===========
  cmm_test is a test utility that allow user verify supported functions of CMM driver. The utility 
  support various CMM functions, such as:
    + Change display color tone through a set of built-in 1D/3D color lookup table (LUT)
    + Configure method for color histogram calculation
    + Read color histogram data and display bar chart

Options
=======
  --display -d
    Screen ID of display used for the test.

  --image -i
    File system path of the image being used for the test. Accepted image format are JPEG, PNG.

  --command -c
    Select supported testing functions, default is set-lut command. Following values are accepted:
       set-lut
       set-clu
       read-hgo

  --hgo-ctrl -p
    Select whether color histogram is calculated before LUT or CLU. Default is before CLU. This option 
    is used combined with read-hgo command. Following values are accepted:
       before-clu
       before-lut

  --hgo-mode -m
    Configure method to calculate color histogram. User should set a 8-bits value that is correspond to
    bit 0-7 of CM2_HGO_MODE register. This option is used combined with read-hgo command. Default mode
    is 0x00.

  --hgo-rect -r
    Select image ROI that need to be calculated color histogram. This option is used combined with 
    read-hgo command.

Example
=======
  1) Change display color tone using builtin 1D LUT:
     $ cmm_test --display=1 --command=set-lut --image=/tmp/sample.jpg

  2) Change display color tone using builtin 3D LUT (CLU):
     $ cmm_test --display=1 --command=set-clu --image=/tmp/sample.jpg

  3) Calculate and show color histogram:
     $ cmm_test --display=1 --command=read-hgo --hgo-rect=0,0,1280,720 --image=/tmp/sample.jpg
