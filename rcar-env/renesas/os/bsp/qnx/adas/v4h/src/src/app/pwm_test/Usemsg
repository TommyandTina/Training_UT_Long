PWM test utility for R-Car based platforms

Options
=======
  --channel -c
    Set PWM channel. Default is channel 0

  --cycle_sec -s
    Set duration (in second) for one PWM cycle. Default is one second

  --cycle_nsec -n
    Set duration (in nanosecond) for one PWM cycle. Default is 0

  --duty -d
    Set duty cycle (in percentage). Default is 50%

  --oneshot -o
    Enable single pulse mode, PWM will operate only for a single cycle then stop.

Example
=======
  1) Start PWM channel 7, period is 1.5 second, duty cycle is 25%
     $ pwm_test -c 7 -s 1 -n 500000000 -d 25

  2) Start PWM channel 5, period is 100ms, duty cycle is 50%, single pulse mode
     $ pwm_test -c 5 -n 100000000 -d 50 -o
