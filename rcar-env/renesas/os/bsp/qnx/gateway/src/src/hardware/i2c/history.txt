            - Support S4
            04.12.2022 : Ver.0.4
            - Optimize/enhance code in DMA stransfer
            - Based HWM to fix "0: Setting prohibited" for MDBS bit of ICMCR register
            - Remove I2C rcar-B folder
            05.30.2022 : Ver.0.5
            - Update in DMA init function due to update of DMA lib
