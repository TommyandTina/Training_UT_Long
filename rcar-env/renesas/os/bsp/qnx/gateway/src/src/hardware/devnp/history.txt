    TARGET OS : QNX SDP 7.1

    HISTORY   :
            10.30.2021 : Ver.0.1
            - Support eTSN (rswtich2) driver for S4
            11.30.2021 : Ver.0.2
            - Support gPTP.
            04.12.2022 : Ver.0.3
            - Change to base addr instead struct rswitch2_serdes_t for read/write Serdes register
            - Add rswitch2_serdes_common_init_ram() and rswitch2_serdes_common_setting()
            - Change only sue GWCA0 for 3 ports (same as Linux)
            - Remove settings for IPV remapping configuration, Reset TAS RAM, Setting flow (U-boot uses, Linux doesn't)
            - Optimize/enhance Event, Transfer and Receive code to improve tx and rx performance
            06.30.2022 : Ver.0.4
            - eTSN (rswtich2) driver : Add interrupt delay to improve performance, this is based on HWM:
                                     "Interrupt delay function aims at delaying data interrupts 
                                      to accumulate data during a certain among of time before requesting software 
                                      to process the data. As a result, software load is diminished, and data latency 
                                      is still guaranteed."
            07.30.2022 : Ver.0.5
            - Update Phy m88e2110_parse_status() to set speed to 2.5G if parsing speed is 5000Mbps and 10000Mbps
            - Add in 'resource seed' to avoid HW access confliction.
            11.03.2022 : Ver.0.6
            - Add parallel_mode support to operate with Realtime core simultaneously.
            - Add limit rate setting for GWCA.
            - Fix ping duplicate and lost packets issue when 2 ports using same GWCA.
            22.02.2023 : Ver.0.7
            - Update interrupt handler to fix receiving interrupt lost
            - Fix 'SerDes Link up' issue when booting QNX ifs image from eMMC
            - Correct base address in serdes common setting (in different channel 0 setting)
