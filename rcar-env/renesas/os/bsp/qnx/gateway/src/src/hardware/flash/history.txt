    HISTORY   :
            10.28.2020 : Ver.0.1
            - Create new version from QNX7.0 driver for V3U
            02.28.2021 : Ver.0.2
            - Update for R-Car Gen3
            09.30.2021 : Ver.0.3
            - Support for S4
            12.30.2021 : Ver.0.4
            - Set internal strobe delay in external read to 7 and write buffer to 15
            - Add DMA transfer unit for 32-bytes and 64-bytes cases
            - Add "wbuf" starting driver option for using write buffer mode used to write data to QSPI flash
            08.10.2022 : Ver0.5
            - Optimize the code
            09.16.2022 : Ver0.6

                                  Reading RPC registers with CacheON may hit the data cache by mistake.
                                  Wrong data is read.
            - Add "strobe" option to control Strobe Timing Adjustment (PHYCNT register) and set STRTIM to 15 as default for Gen4
